#ESP32 ENVIRONMENTAL MONITOR WITH ARDUINO IoT CLOUD

This project uses an ESP32 to monitor a room's environment in real-time. It tracks temperature, humidity, light, and sound levels, and sends the data to the Arduino IoT Cloud for a live, interactive dashboard. The system also provides local visual (LED) and audible (buzzer) alerts for high temperatures or low light.

ðŸ“ˆ Live Dashboard

The dashboard provides a live view of all sensors, as well as historical data in charts. It also features a "Mute" switch to remotely silence the on-device buzzer.
The live dashboard images can be found in the MEDIA/DASHBOARD/ folder.

âœ¨ Features

Live Sensor Monitoring: Tracks Temperature, Humidity, Sound Level (amplitude), and Ambient Light.
Cloud Logging: All data is logged and graphed on the Arduino IoT Cloud.
Local Feedback System:
Â    High Temp Alert: Red LED + dual-tone beep(controlled by an NPN transistor).
Â    Low Light Warning: Yellow LED.
Â    All Systems OK: Blue LED.
Â    Sensor Error: All three LEDs flash to indicate a sensor read failure.
Remote Mute Switch: A switch on the dashboard can remotely silence the buzzer.

3. Software & Cloud Setup

Arduino IoT Cloud

This project requires a free Arduino IoT Cloud account.

1.  Log in to the Arduino IoT Cloud and create a new "Thing".
2.  Link your ESP32 board.
3.  Go to the "Network" tab and enter your Wi-Fi credentials.
4.  Go to the "Setup" tab and create the following 5 variables:

| Variable Name | Type                  | Permission  |
| :------------ | :-------------------- | :---------- |
|  temp         | CloudTemperature      |  Read Only  |
|  humid        | CloudRelativeHumidity |  Read Only  |
|  light_level  | int                   |  Read Only  |
|  sound_level  | int                   |  Read Only  |
|  muteSwitch   | bool                  | Read/Write  |

5.  After creating these, the cloud will provide you with a `thingProperties.h` file and a skeleton `.ino` file. Download them and place them in the `/CODE/src` folder.

Project Code

This is the complete and final code for the main `.ino` file. It includes the logic to prevent `NaN` errors from the DHT sensor, which keeps the graphs clean and reliable.
